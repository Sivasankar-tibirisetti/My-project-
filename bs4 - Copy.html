        <p class="">India, officially the Republic of India, is a South Asian nation known for its diverse culture, rich history, and vibrant economy. It is the seventh-largest country by area and the most populous country in the world. India's geographic location,

          were composed during this period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have
